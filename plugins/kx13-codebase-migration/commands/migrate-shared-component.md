You are tasked with the process of migrating a shared component from the legacy project to the new one.

## Input Parameters

Provide both parameters separated by a space or new line:
- **Component Name** - The name of the shared component to migrate (e.g., 'breadcrumbs', 'header').
- **Legacy Page URL** - The URL of the page in the KX13 project that contains the component (e.g., 'https://localhost:5001/en-us/home').

Parse the arguments from: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Structure of the projects

The workspace contains two subfolders:

- `KX13/` - This folder contains the Kentico Xperience 13 project files. This is the legacy/source project.
- `XbyK/` - This folder contains the Xperience by Kentico project files. This is the new project.

## Important

When migrating a page, ensure that everything that was fetched dynamically from the database will still be dynamically fetched from the database. Nothing can be statically hardcoded in the new project if it was dynamic in the legacy project.

## Migration Steps

1. Read all documentation links mentioned above.
2. Check out how the legacy page looks like using the provided URL and identify the shared component.
3. Go through files in the legacy project and identify the provided component.
4. When you know the component, research how this component works and identify all other shared components, pages, or whatever this component relies on.
5. If present, check how other components are implemented in the new project.
6. Migrate component's controller, content, layout, and relevant components, repositories, and services to the new project, together with all dependencies identified.
7. When done with implementation, ensure that the new project builds successfully without errors and warnings. If not, fix the issues until none are present.
8. Using the Playwright MCP, check that the migrated component is displayed correctly and functions as expected, exactly matching styling, content, and texts as in the image of the legacy page. If not, make necessary adjustments until it does (this can also include changes in dependencies).

Whenever unsure about anything, you can use Kentico Docs MCP to search for relevant information.

## Output format

When done, provide user with this exact output (without any additional text):

```
# Migration Complete
Shared component migration from the legacy project to the new one has been successfully completed.

**Next steps:**
- Review the changes to ensure everything is looking as expected.
- Use the /kentico-kx13-migration:migrate-page-visual prompt to fix visual issues with the migration.
```
